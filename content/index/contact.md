# The contact form uses www.formspree.io as default email proxy.
# Visitors can send up to a 1000 emails each month for free.
#
# What you need to do for the setup?
#
# - set your email address under 'email' below
# - upload the generated site to your server
# - send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
# - click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
# - you're done. Happy mailing!

# It is possible to substitute formspring with other providers.
# Example: Mailout plugin from caddy.
# Provide a URL to post to and add necessary custom javascript.
#postURL = "https://example.com/mailout/"

# Email can be set here or within config.toml.
# The email setting from config.toml takes precedent.
